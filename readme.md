###Steps
1. ~~URL -> HTML~~
2. ~~HTML -> Plain text~~
3. ~~Plain text -> Tokenized Strings~~
4. ~~Toknized strings -> Sorted String[]~~
5. ~~Sorted String[] -> ArrayList<Word(#, string)>~~
6. ~~ArrayList<Word(#, string)> -> ArrayList<Word> by part of speech~~
7. ~~ArrayList<Word> by part of speech -> 2D array of Strings by part of speech~~
8. ~~2D + templetes -> Text of tweet~~
9. Text of tweet -> Image and tweet using twitter API?

 #####Issues
 - GET rid of punctuation (maylis)
 - Test all the way done to tweet (maylis)
 - Fix URL area (HTTP error 403) (Caroline)
 - Get image (j-labels) (Caroline)
 - User Input later when we have time (both?)
 - Create new tweets and more detail
 - Real issue is somewhere between PartOfSpeech and the real MadLibs (although it's probably before that)
